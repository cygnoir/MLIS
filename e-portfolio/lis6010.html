		<h3>Work Examples</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="documents/Bernard_Halsted_LIS_Leaders_Paper.docx">Library Leader: Minnie Earl Sears</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://6010socialnetworking.wordpress.com/">Social Networking: Adoption and Impact on Libraries</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Evaluative Statement</h3>
			LIS 6010, Introduction to the Information Profession, is the first core course that each new SLIS student must take. In 6010, students examine the history of librarianship, the significance of the library in society, and practical and theoretical issues within the field. <br /><br />
			My first example of work is my paper on Minnie Earl Sears, the creator of the Sears List. I discussed her contributions to the field of library science as well as the potential for using the Sears List to enhance folksonomies in Web 2.0 library tools. While I was researching my paper, I became fascinated with the idea of using the Sears List to enhance folksonomies on the Web, and entertained the idea of creating a Bernard List to do just that.<br /><br />
			My second example consists of my contributions to a group blog. Our blog was on the topic of social networking in libraries, and sparked some interesting discussions among our classmates. It was a pleasure to collaborate on this project with my group, and I learned a great deal about using web-based tools like Google Docs as well as email to coordinate a team around a complex project. My post <a href="http://6010socialnetworking.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/revitalizing-old-systems-with-new-technologies/">"Revitalizing Old Systems with New Technologies"</a> was about social software components integrated in OPACs, and <a href="http://6010socialnetworking.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/library-services-in-virtual-spaces/">"Library Services in Virtual Spaces"</a> explored reference services via instant messaging and in Second Life.
